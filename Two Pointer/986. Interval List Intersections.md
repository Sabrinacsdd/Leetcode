## Keyword
Two Pointer

## Problem description
```
Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

 

Example 1:



Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects, and not arrays or lists.
 

Note:

0 <= A.length < 1000
0 <= B.length < 1000
0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9
```

            int right = Math.min(A[i][1], B[j][1]);
            //there is intervals if left < right
            if(left <= right){
                ans.add(new int[]{left, right});
            }
            //check to move pointer, depends on which pointer ends earlier
            if(A[i][1] >= B[j][1]){
                j++;
            }
