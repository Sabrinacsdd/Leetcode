## Problem description
```
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        HashSet<Character> je = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < J.length(); ++i){
            je.add(J.charAt(i));
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < S.length(); ++i){
            if(je.contains(S.charAt(i))){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
