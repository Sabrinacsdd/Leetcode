## Problem description
```
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
## Notes
// Approach 2: Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm
Only need to check the hare, cause if the n is equal to 1, the next number will also be 1.
For return, just need to check if hare == 1, if hare != 1, means one the condition to break out the loop is fare == tortoise.
