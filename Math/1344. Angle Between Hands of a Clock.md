```java
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        //hours
        double h = hour == 12 ? 0 :30 * (double) hour;
        double attach = (double)minutes / 60 * 30;
        //minutes
        double m = 6 * (double) minutes;
        double a =Math.abs(h + attach - m);
        double b = Math.abs(360 - m + (h + attach));
        double c = Math.abs(360 - (h + attach) + m);
        return Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
    }
}
