https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Keyword
Binary Srach/Array

## Problem description
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```



## Notes
Corner case:
[3,1] target 1
[] target 1
Pay attention to when to use "="

```java
//Binary search
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if(nums.length == 0) return -1;
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;
        int mid;
        while(l < r){
            mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            //if it's sorted array in the first half
            //there must be nums[l] <= nums[mid]  "="
            if(nums[l] <= nums[mid]){
                if(nums[l] <= target && target < nums[mid]){
                    r = mid;
                }
                else{
                    l = mid + 1;
                }       
            }else{                        //it should be sorted array in from mid to r
                if(nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[r]){
                    l = mid + 1;
                }
                else{
                    r = mid;
                }
            }
        }
        return nums[l] == target ? l : -1;
    }
