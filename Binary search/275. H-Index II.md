## Problem description
```
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

## Things to watchout

## 06/18/20 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        if (citations.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        //Arrays.sort(citations);
        int len = citations.length;
        int l = 0;
        int r = citations.length - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] >= len - mid) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        //postprocessing l
        if (citations[l] == len - l - 1) {
            return citations[l];
        } else {
            return len - l;
        }
    }
}

```

## Notes
```
Use binary search to find the first index that satisfies citations[index] >= n - index.Note such index might not exists so the starting right bound needs to be n.
