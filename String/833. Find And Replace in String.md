## Keyword
String

## Problem description
```
To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing.

For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with "ffff".

Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.

All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case.

Example 1:

Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["a","cd"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
"cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".
Example 2:

Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeecd"
Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee". 
"ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.
Notes:

0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100
0 < indexes[i] < S.length <= 1000
All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters.

## 05/21/20 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public String findReplaceString(String S, int[] indexes, String[] sources, String[] targets) {
        //i is the pointer point to String S
        //j is the pointer point to current indexes, sources, targets
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        //Sort the indexes
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int m = 0; m < indexes.length; ++m){
            list.add(new int[]{indexes[m], m});
        }
        
        Collections.sort(list, (a, b)-> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        while (j < indexes.length){
            int curIdx = list.get(j)[0];
            int idx = list.get(j)[1];
            sb.append(S.substring(i, curIdx));
            i = curIdx;
            //check if sources match
            if (S.substring(curIdx, curIdx + sources[idx].length()).equals(sources[idx])){
                //if match

                sb.append(targets[idx]);
                i += sources[idx].length();
            } else { // if does not match

            }
            ++j;
        }
        sb.append(S.substring(i));
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```
## Complexity Analyze
Time: O(nlog n + S)   n is the length of indexes,  S the is length of S   \
Space: O(S + T)  T is the total length of target

```java
class Solution {
  public String findReplaceString(String S, int[] indexes, String[] sources, String[] targets) {
        List<int[]> sorted = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0 ; i < indexes.length; i++) sorted.add(new int[]{indexes[i], i});
        Collections.sort(sorted, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        for (int[] ind: sorted) {
            int i = ind[0], j = ind[1];
            String s = sources[j], t = targets[j];
            if (S.substring(i, i + s.length()).equals(s)) S = S.substring(0, i) + t + S.substring(i + s.length());
        }
        return S;
    }
}
