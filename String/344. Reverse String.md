## Keyword
String

## Problem description
```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity : \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) to swap N/2N/2 element.

Space complexity : \mathcal{O}(1)O(1), it's a constant space solution.

    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
            for (int i = 0, j =s.length-1; i<j; i++ , j--){
            char temp=s[i];
            s[i]=s[j];
            s[j]=temp;
