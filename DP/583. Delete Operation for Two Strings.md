## Problem description
```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

Example 1:
Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Note:
The length of given words won't exceed 500.
Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        //dp array saves the min operation need to do for the current index
        int[][] dp = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= word1.length(); ++i){
            for (int j = 0; j <= word2.length(); ++j){
                if (i == 0 && j == 0){
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }else if (i == 0 || j == 0){
                    dp[i][j] = i == 0 ? j : i;

                    //dp[i][j] - > char word1 i - 1 .... char word2 i - 2;
                    if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)){
                        //if the charcter are the same, we don't need to delete either
                       dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; 
                    }else {
                        //find the min of the either close one and plus the current character
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1;
