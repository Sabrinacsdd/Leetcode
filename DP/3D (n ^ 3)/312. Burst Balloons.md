## Problem description
```
Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Note:

You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
Example:

Input: [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] nums) {
        //create newNums for padding, add 1 to from and end
        int[] newNums = new int[nums.length + 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i){
            newNums[i + 1] = nums[i];
        }
        newNums[0] = 1;
        newNums[newNums.length - 1] = 1;
        //dp array store the maximum coins could collect that from i to j at dp[i][j]
        int[][] dp = new int[newNums.length][newNums.length];
        //traverse the length
        for (int len = 1; len <= nums.length; ++len){
            //i is the beginning index
            for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length - len + 1; ++i){
                //j is the ending index
                int j = len + i - 1;
                //k is between i and j
                for (int k = i; k <= j; ++k){
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k - 1] + dp[k + 1][j] + newNums[i - 1] * newNums[k] * newNums[j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[1][newNums.length - 2];
    }
