## Keyword
DP

## Problem description
```
You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability prob[i] of facing heads when tossed.

Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target if you toss every coin exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
Output: 0.40000
Example 2:

Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
Output: 0.03125
 

Constraints:

1 <= prob.length <= 1000
0 <= prob[i] <= 1
0 <= target <= prob.length
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

```java
class Solution {
    public double probabilityOfHeads(double[] prob, int target) {
        //dp array saves the possibility at current index(target), with in n coins
        double[] dp = new double[prob.length + 1];
        dp[0] = 1.0;
        //put a coin to the dp each time to compute possibility
        for (double n : prob){
            //dp2 as a rolling dp to save the possibility after one more coin added
            double[] dp2 = new double[prob.length + 1];
            for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; ++i){
                if (dp[i] != 0){
                    dp2[i + 1] += dp[i] * n;
                    dp2[i] += dp[i] * (1 - n);
                }
            }
            dp = dp2;
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
