DP / Math / Bit manipulation

## Problem description
```
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] ans = new int[num + 1];
        ans[0] = 0;
        int pow = 1;
        int lastp = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i){
            if (i == pow){
                ans[i] = 1;
                lastp = pow;    
                pow = pow * 2;                
            } else {
                ans[i] = 1 + ans[i - lastp];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
