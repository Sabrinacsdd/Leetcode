## Problem description
```
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

 

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.
```

    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        recursion(m - 1, n - 1, dp);
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
    public int recursion(int i, int j, int[][] dp){
        if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i > dp.length || j > dp[0].length){
            return 0;
        }
        if(i == 0 && j == 0){
            dp[0][0] = 1;
            return 1;
        }
        if(dp[i][j] != 0){
            return dp[i][j];
        }
        
        
        dp[i][j] =  recursion(i - 1, j, dp) + recursion(i, j - 1, dp);
        return dp[i][j];
    }
}
