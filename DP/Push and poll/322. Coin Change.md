## Problem description
```
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
Example 2:

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        //dp saves the number could be possible for current amount
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; ++i){
            //traverse all the possible coins the in the coins array
            for (int n : coins){
                if (i - n < 0 || dp[i - n] == -1){
                    continue;
                } else {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - n] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1: dp[amount];
    }
}
