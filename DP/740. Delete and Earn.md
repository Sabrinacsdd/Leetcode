## Problem description
```
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
 

Note:

The length of nums is at most 20000.
Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int[] dp = new int[nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0] + 1];
        //[2,2,3,3,3,4] - > [4,9,4]
        //the new array has larget number - smallest number quantity
        //each number will be added to their position
        for(int n : nums){
            dp[n - nums[0]] += n;
        }
        return robHouse(dp);
    }
    //similar to question 198
    public int robHouse(int[] dp){
        int prev = 0;
        int last = 0;
        for(int n : dp){
            int now = Math.max(prev + n, last);
            prev = last;
            last = now;
        }
        return last;
    }
