## Keyword
Binary Tree

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]


 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
```

    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
      if (root == null || root == p || root == q)
        // found p or q or touch the ground
        return root;

      // search p and q from left and right
      TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
      TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

      if (left != null && right != null)
        // from root's left & right we found both p and q, so root is the LCA
        return root;
      else
        // left is not null means from left's left & right we found both q and q
        // so left is the LCA, otherwise, right is the answer
        return left != null ? left : right;
    }
}
