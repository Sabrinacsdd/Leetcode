## Keyword
Tree

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

        ans = 0;
        length(root);
        return ans;
    }
    public int length(TreeNode node){
        if(node == null) return 0;
       // to store the R and L, since we will use them in return, prevent calculation again to make TLE
        int L = length(node.left);
        int R = length(node.right);
        //max compare with the current L + R
        ans = Math.max(ans, L + R);
        //return the current L plus the edge will form to the parent
        return Math.max(L + 1, R + 1);
    }
