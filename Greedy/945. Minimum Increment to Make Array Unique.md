## Keyword
String

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers A, a move consists of choosing any A[i], and incrementing it by 1.

Return the least number of moves to make every value in A unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:  After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation:  After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.
 

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 40000
0 <= A[i] < 40000
```

        Arrays.sort(A);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; ++i) {
            if (A[i] <= A[i - 1]) {
                //if the current number is less or equal to the number
                //we add the number that we should change to the current number to be to the ans
                ans += A[i - 1] + 1 - A[i];
                //change the number to the number it should be
                A[i] = A[i - 1] + 1;
                
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
