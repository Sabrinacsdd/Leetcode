## Problem description
```
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                ans[i] = Math.max(ans[i + 1] + 1, ans[i]);
            }
        }
        
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : ans) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Iterate from left to right and assign the minimum candies each child should have.
Iterate from right to left,  check if it's follow the rule to the right child, and assign candies to each child by satisfiy both left and right.
