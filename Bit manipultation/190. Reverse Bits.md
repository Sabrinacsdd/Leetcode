## Problem description
```
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output: 00111001011110000010100101000000
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
Example 2:

Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 10111111111111111111111111111111
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
 

Note:

Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

## Things to watchout

## 07/12/20 Java

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int mask = 1;
        int ans = 0;
        int c = 0;
        while (c < 32) {
            int cur = n & mask;
            if (cur != 0) {
                int check = 1 << (32 - c - 1);
                ans = (ans) | (1 << (32 - c - 1));
            }
            
            mask = mask << 1;
            ++c;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

## 07/12/20 Java
```Java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        n = (n >>> 16) | (n << 16);
        n = ((n & 0xff00ff00) >>> 8) | ((n & 0x00ff00ff) << 8);
        n = ((n & 0xf0f0f0f0) >>> 4) | ((n & 0x0f0f0f0f) << 4);
        n = ((n & 0xcccccccc) >>> 2) | ((n & 0x33333333) << 2);
        n = ((n & 0xaaaaaaaa) >>> 1) | ((n & 0x55555555) << 1);
        return n;
    }
}
```

## Notes
Algorithm

We can implement the algorithm in the following steps:

1). First, we break the original 32-bit into 2 blocks of 16 bits, and switch them.

2). We then break the 16-bits block into 2 blocks of 8 bits. Similarly, we switch the position of the 8-bits blocks

3). We then continue to break the blocks into smaller blocks, until we reach the level with the block of 1 bit.

4). At each of the above steps, we merge the intermediate results into a single integer which serves as the input for the next step.
