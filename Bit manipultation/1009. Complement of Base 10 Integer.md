Bit Manipulation

## Problem description
```
Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.

For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
Example 2:

Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
 

Note:

0 <= N < 10^9

## Approach 4: highestOneBit OpenJDK algorithm from Hacker's Delight
```Java
class Solution {
  public int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
    if (N == 0) return 1;
    // bitmask has the same length as N and contains only ones 1...1
    int bitmask = N;
    bitmask |= (bitmask >> 1);
    bitmask |= (bitmask >> 2);
    bitmask |= (bitmask >> 4);
    bitmask |= (bitmask >> 8);
    bitmask |= (bitmask >> 16);
    // flip all bits 
    return bitmask ^ N;
  }
}

## Approach 1: Flip Bit by Bit
```Java
class Solution {
  public int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
    if (N == 0) return 1;
    int todo = N, bit = 1;
    while (todo != 0) {
      // flip current bit
      N = N ^ bit;
      // prepare for the next run
      bit = bit << 1;
      todo = todo >> 1;
    }
    return N;
  }

## Approach 2: Compute Bit Length and Construct 1-bits Bitmask
```Java
class Solution {
  public int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
    // l is a length of N in binary representation
    int l = (int)( Math.log(N) / Math.log(2) ) + 1;
    // bitmask has the same length as num and contains only ones 1...1
    int bitmask = (1 << l) - 1;
    // flip all bits
    return bitmask ^ N;
  }
