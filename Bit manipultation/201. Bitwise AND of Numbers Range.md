## Problem description
```
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: [0,1]
Output: 0
```

```java
class Solution {
  public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
    int shift = 0;
    // find the common 1-bits
    while (m < n) {
      m >>= 1;
      n >>= 1;
      ++shift;
    }
    return m << shift;
  }
}

```
## Notes
As stated in the intuition section, the algorithm consists of two steps:\

We reduce both numbers into their common prefix, by doing right shift iteratively. During the iteration, we keep the count on the number of shift operations we perform.\
With the common prefix, we restore it to its previous position, by left shifting.
