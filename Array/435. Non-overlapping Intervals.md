## Keyword
Greedy / Array

## Problem description
```
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        
        //corner case
        if (intervals.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // sort by the end point
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        
        int ans = 1;
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        //compare all the point with last possible point
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; ++i) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= end) {
                end = intervals[i][1];
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        
        return intervals.length - ans;
        
    }
