## Keyword
Array

## Problem description
```
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

## Things to watchout

## 10/16/2019 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int i=0;
        //int j=1;
        
        for(int j=1;j<nums.length; j++){
            if(nums[i]!=nums[j]){
                ++i;
                nums[i]=nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i+1;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complextiy : O(n). Assume that nn is the length of array. Each of ii and jj traverses at most nn steps.

Space complexity : O(1)O(1).
