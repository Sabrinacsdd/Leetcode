## Problem description
```
There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.

Given an array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend], return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Example 4:

Input: points = [[1,2]]
Output: 1
Example 5:

Input: points = [[2,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

0 <= points.length <= 104
points.length == 2
-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1

```java
class Solution {
  public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
    if (points.length == 0) return 0;

    // sort by x_end
    Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1],b[1]));
  

    int arrows = 1;
    int xStart, xEnd, firstEnd = points[0][1];
    for (int[] p : points) {
      xStart = p[0];
      xEnd = p[1];
      // if the current balloon starts after the end of another one,
      // one needs one more arrow
      if (firstEnd < xStart) {
        arrows++;
        firstEnd = xEnd;
      }
    }

    return arrows;
  }
}

## Notes
Use Integer.compareTo when compare two numbers instead of (a - b) to prevent overflow.
