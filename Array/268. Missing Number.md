## Things to watchout

## 01/15/2020 Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n=nums.length;
        int total= (1+n)*n/2;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
            total=total-nums[i];
        }
        return total;
    }
}

```
## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity : \mathcal{O}(n)O(n)

Although Gauss' formula can be computed in \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) time, summing nums costs us \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time, so the algorithm is overall linear. Because we have no information about which number is missing, an adversary could always design an input for which any algorithm that examines fewer than nn numbers fails. Therefore, this solution is asymptotically optimal.

Space complexity : \mathcal{O}(1)O(1)

This approach only pushes a few integers around, so it has constant memory usage.
