## Keyword
Stack

## Problem description
```
Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

 

Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
 

Note:

0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
pushed is a permutation of popped.
pushed and popped have distinct values.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        int n = pushed.length;
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
        //i for pushed pointer, j for popped pointer
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        for (var x : pushed) {
            s.push(x);
            while (!s.isEmpty() && j < n && s.peek() == popped[j]) {
                s.pop();
                ++j;
            }
        }
        return j == n;
    }
}
