## Problem description
```
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

# DFS
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        //build the graph
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (var edge : prerequisites) {
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        int[] visitStatus = new int[numCourses];
        //use dfs to try to find cycle in the directed graph
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (visitStatus[i] != 2 && cycle(graph, visitStatus, i)) {
                return false; 
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    private boolean cycle(List<Integer>[] graph, int[] visitStatus, int curr) {
        //if we encouter a node that is being visited, we found a cycle
        if (visitStatus[curr] == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        //mark as visiting
        visitStatus[curr] = 1;
        //dfs all neighbors
        for (int nei : graph[curr]) {
            if (visitStatus[nei] != 2 && cycle(graph, visitStatus, nei)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        //mark as visited
        visitStatus[curr] = 2;
        return false;
    }

        //if there are still some edges left, then there exits cycles
        //due to dead lock,(dependency), we cannot remove the cyclic edges

        else return false;

class Gnode{
    public Integer inDegree = 0;
    public List<Integer> outNodes = new LinkedList<>();
}
```
## Things to watchout
```
Doesn't need a visited hashSet. Since all node put into the queue when and only when their's indegree is equal to zero. Means no node pointing to them, so they will not be put in the queue or visit again.
